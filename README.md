# Video Game Deals API

The purpose of this project was to practice React.js, TypeScript, and API fetching.

This website uses the [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/). This API has the data of thousands of video games. Simply search a game and it will find you the best deals available online with links to purchase it.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Typescript, React.js, deployed using Google Firebase

## Familiarized myself with:
- React.js hooks (State/Effect)
- Asynchronous API (async/await)
- JSX, components, props, etc.
- TypeScript (type system/interfaces)
